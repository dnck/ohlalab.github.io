**Figure 1.**

This is a test template to show how the templates work.

It uses the layout file, ```single_image_template.html```, located in the layouts folder.

By giving the front matter an image name (e.g. ```myimage.png```), you can display an image at the top of your blog post. The image is flexible, so it will adjusts itself to the size of the viewport.

Note the image file should be in the ohlalab github folder, ```/images/``` .

You can also feed a title into the front matter section, and it will give the blog post a title, which appears above the image.

Directly underneath of the image, the template will insert any content in the blog.

You can make your own templates as complex as you like.

Check out the two_content_blocks_template.html file, and the post, Example of the two content blocks, for another example.
